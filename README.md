####Assumptions:  
1.the program input is in fixed format which is same as provided in sample input/output.  
2.runs this application on jdk 1.8 or above version. 

####Steps to run this application:   
1.download the zip file & load into your IDE.  
2.compile the project, this is very important, otherwise you may hit no junit runner exception.  
3.run junit test directly - org.akj.algorithm.merchant.TradeAppplicationTest, there is testRun method.    

####Todo list for myself:  
1.to extract & declare const varaibles  
2.to verify more test cases, like character repeating & unexpected subtraction  
3.to handle the exception, rather than just throw out  
4.input validation
